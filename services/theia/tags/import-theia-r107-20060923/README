NOTE: I do not develop this code anymore, please do not bother me about
bugs/features/whatever.

This is dancer-services (dancer-hybserv), a somewhat patched version
of hybserv which is intended to be used with dancer-ircd. It won't
work with any other ircd.

It is essentially the same as hybserv, only it uses the dancer
protocol and understands some of dancer's extended features.

See README.hybserv for more information (this is the mostly unchanged
hybserv README file).
