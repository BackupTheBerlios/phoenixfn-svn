Syntax: %bRECOVER <nickname> [password]%b

If someone has stolen your nickname, you can use
%bRECOVER%b to get it back.  %bRECOVER%b performs
a nick collide on %b<nickname>%b and enforces the
nickname until you use the %bRELEASE%b command on
it, or just wait until the release timeout.  If
you match a hostmask on %b<nickname>%b's %bACCESS%b
list, and %b<nickname>%b has NOT %bSET SECURE%b ON,
or if you are identified to a linked nickname,
you do not need to supply a password.
Otherwise, you have to supply the correct
password.
