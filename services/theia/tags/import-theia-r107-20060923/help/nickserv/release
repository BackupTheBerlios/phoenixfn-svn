Syntax: %bRELEASE <nickname> [password]%b

If %b%N%b is enforcing your nickname, as it would
after a %bRECOVER%b or if you didn't %bIDENTIFY%b
in time, you can use %bRELEASE%b to regain control
of your nickname.  If you match a hostmask on
%b<nickname>%b's %bACCESS%b list, and %b<nickname>%b's
%bSET SECURE%b is OFF, or if you are
identified to a linked nickname, you do not
need to supply a password.  Otherwise, you
have to supply the correct password.
