Syntax: %bREGISTER <channel> [password]%b

Registers <channel> in %C's database.  %b[password]%b is
used via %C %bIDENTIFY%b to identify the channel contact
for some functions. If no password is specified, only
the channel contact nick can use %C %bIDENTIFY%b.

Guidelines for running a freenode channel are found here:
http://freenode.net/channel_guidelines.shtml Pick someone
to register your project channel who is around frequently. 
If your channel contact's nick expires,
%C will drop their channel when %N drops
their nick. Consider setting an %bALTERNATE%b (%b/msg%b
%b%C HELP SET ALTERNATE%b) to avoid
this situation.

Give channel staffers the ability to maintain
your channel via the %bACCESS%b command (%b/msg %C%b
%bHELP ACCESS%b).  Level '10' lets them gain ops,
voice and devoice users, etc. Try to ensure your
channel has 24-hour coverage.  Staffers should
%bIDENTIFY%b to %N so that their nicks don't expire,
and so that %C will recognize them.

If no one on a channel's %bACCESS%b list enters the
channel within 120 days, the channel will be
considered expired and may be dropped.
