Syntax: %bIDENTIFY <channel> [password]%b

Identifies you as the channel contact for %b<channel>%b. 
Some %C commands require that you %bIDENTIFY%b before
using them.

If you are the contact (your master nick is equal to
the stored contact nick), you need not use the channel
password, otherwise you have to. If there is no channel
password, only the contact nick can use this command.
