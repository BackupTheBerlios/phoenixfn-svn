Syntax: %bSET <channel> ALTERNATE <nickname|->%b

Sets the alternate channel contact to <nickname>.  If the
contact's nickname ever expires, services will make the
alternate contact the new contact.  If both the contact and
the alternate contact nicknames expire, the channel will be
dropped.

The alternate contact needs to be on the access list as
well.

To clear the alternate contact, use a "-" for the nickname.
