INSTALLATION 

 In order to compile theia, you should perform the following steps:

    1) Enter the theia tree and run ./configure, a GNU 
       configure script, which should find whatever it needs for
       compilation.

    2) Edit include/config.h and change the information to suit
       your IRC Network.  Also, be sure to edit bin/services.conf
       to set up the services to work with your network. (This is
       the file where you can give others access to theia)

    3) Run 'make' in the theia tree to compile the package.
       When make finishes, you'll probably want to:
       'strip bin/dancer-services' to remove debugging symbols
       from the file, since the author is the only one who
       really uses it.  It decreases the file size greatly.

    4) Finally, become root if necessary, and run 'make install' to 
       install theia on your system.  The default install directory 
       is /usr/local/dancer-services.  This will automatically chown
       the install directory to the same user who ran the configure
       script, so it won't run as root.  You can change the user by
       editing Makefile.

    5) You may wish to remove any objects/binaries created during
       installation.  You can do this via 'make clean'.  If you
       wish to remove any configure generated files as well, use
       'make distclean'.

	 ** Note: if you want to install theia in a directory other than
            /usr/local/dancer-services, you must run the configure
            script with the --prefix option.

    For example, if you want to install HybServ2 in /home/mydir:

       ./configure --prefix=/home/mydir
       make
       make install

     Then, HybServ2 will be installed in /home/mydir/dancer-services.


  theia is known to compile and work on FreeBSD 4.x/5.x and
  Linux 2.4.x/2.6.x; it may also work on other operating systems.

  HybServ2 was originally developed under Linux 2.0 on a Pentium 200.
  HybServ2 is known to compile cleanly on the following operating systems,
  and may compile on others.

    Linux 2.4.x (and older)
    FreeBSD 4.3 (and older)
    OpenBSD 2.7 (and older)
    Solaris 2.7 (and older)
    Digital Unix 4.0
