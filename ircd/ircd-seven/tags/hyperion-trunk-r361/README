hyperion 1.0
------------

NOTE: I does not develop this code anymore. Please do not bother me
with bugs/features/whatever about this.

-- jilles, Dec 19 2005

This is the current hyperion ircd tree, forked from dancer-ircd 1.0.35+pre2.
Installation: ./configure with options, edit include/config.h and make && make
install. For the configuration file, go to ${prefix}/etc/dancer-ircd/,
copy example.conf to ircd.conf and edit it. Logs are under
${prefix}/var/log/dancer-ircd/.

Important: Make sure to update your client Y:lines when updating from
any version before r336 to r336 or later, otherwise there will not be
any per-IP limiting! See example.conf for the new format.

For any possible updates see the Subversion repository:
http://svn.freenode.net/hyperion/trunk/

This is the current code for the freenode network. The network is looking at
new options for its further development, but will continue to support this
code, at least in the short term.

There are some misc patches in patches/.

There is some formal documentation in doc/sgml/. General TSora documentation
can be useful in understanding the server-server protocol but is not included
here.

Please mail bug reports to bugs@freenode.net, or ask in #hyperion
on freenode.

There are Debian packages available on http://debian.duckcorp.org/
but freenode has nothing to do with these. We have included
this link for the sole reason that many people ask for packages.
If you have a problem with the packages, please try compiling
from source if possible.

Services: Hyperion is designed to run with services; we know of two compatible
services packages: theia, which is a fork of dancer-services (from hybserv2)
and can be checked out from Subversion http://svn.freenode.net/theia/trunk/
and atheme, see http://www.atheme.org and http://www.atheme.net.
Freenode-registry will also run with hyperion, but it comprises a somewhat
unorthodox approach to authentication and authorization which may not meet the
needs of conventional IRC networks.
