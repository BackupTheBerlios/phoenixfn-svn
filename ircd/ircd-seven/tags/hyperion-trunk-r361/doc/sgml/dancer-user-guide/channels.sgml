    <title>Channel management</title>
    <para>
      It is strongly recommended that channels be registered on FN. To do this, become a channel
      operator somehow and "/msg chanserv register #channel password". You can access full online help
      for chanserv, as well as the other services, with "/msg chanserv help". The channel access list
      controls who can do what on the channel, and allows considerable flexibility. Use this rather than
      channel management bots, it's more reliable and avoids sillyness like IRC wars.

      Channel bans and quiets both prevent a person from talking on the channel, but it is recommended
      that you use quiets (+q) if you merely want to shut somebody up; bans are rather deprecated for
      this purpose and their semantics will change at some point in the future.  Generally you should
      assume that a ban means you don't want the person on the channel, while a quiet means you don't
      want them saying anything. Please don't kick people, it's rarely necessary or appropriate, and it
      generates needless noise (as well as raising the channel temperature).

      Hybrid (and therefore dancer) provides ban exceptions. If you have problems from an ISP which
      allows users to trivially change their IP addresses then you may find yourself forced to place a
      ban on the entire ISP. This often catches legitimate users. Set ban exceptions just like normal
      bans, but with mode +e (/mode #channel +e nick!user@host). These users will then be exempt from
      bans. You can then ban by host, but allow specific users by nick, should you need to.
    </para>
    <para>
      Another system available is the channel invex list. A channel which is set +i is invite-only, but
      masks can be added to the invex list with mode +I in the same manner, and the people on the list
      will be able to join without being invited. Note that services cannot (at present) maintain invex
      or exception lists. If a person needs permanent access, then add them to the channel access list in
      chanserv with a level that gives them CMDINVITE access; then can then /msg chanserv invite #channel
      and chanserv will invite them.
    </para>
    <para>
      Channels which have the +g umode set allow anybody to use the INVITE command; on channels where it
      is unset, only channel operators may use INVITE.
    </para>
    <para>
      The REMOVE command can be used exactly like the KICK command, only it sends out PART messages.
