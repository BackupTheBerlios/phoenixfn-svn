Ideas written down by jilles
Not everything of this is possible
- apply patch for +fJD desync (DONE)
- fix or remove ban channel forwarding (trouble if destination
  disappears) (DONE)
- forwarding requires too much trust in the op, fix?
- generally clean up +bdeIq (DONE)
- make +q more independent of +b (DONE)
- prevent splitriding to join -P+ikb channels?
- reinstate difference local vs remote /whois? (DONE)
- rate limit remote /whois in a sane way (i.e. on the requester's server) (DONE)
- remove Channel.keep_their_modes and clear_bans_exceptions_denies() on SJOIN
  when we lose the TS; they are too simplistic to work in general and
  NO_OPS_ON_SPLIT performs the same function. Just keep the bans from both
  sides as TS5 was intended. If we really want this functionality, burst the
  bans with a TS such as in TS6's BMASK. (DONE)
- send a better RPL_ISUPPORT (005) numeric (DONE)
- change some numerics to values used by other ircds
  - RPL_FORWARD should be 4xx? (DONE)
  - probably not much gain to be obtained here otherwise
- clarify error messages (remove "demigods", "hand of diety", etc..) (DONE)
- implement global version of /stats p (decouples #freenode from support a
  bit more) (DONE)
- hide who is opped but not who performs mode changes/kicks/removes/etc?
  (longer term)
- fix remote idle times (IDLE command is broken)
- implement hybrid-style server side ignore ("callerid", umode +g, /accept)?
- change DRONE_FLOOD (single user receives rather a lot of privmsgs) to
  block quicker?
- reorganize dlines: not stored in file, broadcast when set, expiry, UNDLINE
  command (UNDLINE done, rest not)
- fix unresolved-IPv6 K-lines (appears to work although perhaps inefficiently)
- do something about syn floods because of K-lined clients attempting
  to connect continuously, e.g. with a better honeypot mechanism or
  a reject cache
- sometimes k-lined clients quit with "Client Quit", fix this (DONE)
- change dancer-ircd to hyperion in several places (mostly done but not
  in dir names)
- rewrite (in src/s_user.c) user_mode() and send_umode_out(); setting modes
  on other users does not work properly (DONE)
- don't match() all the bans on every channel privmsg; see ircd-ratbox's
  can_send() for how to do this
- use kqueue (FreeBSD), /dev/poll (Solaris) or epoll (Linux) to replace
  the inefficient poll() every time through the main loop; possibly use
  libevent to make the implementation easier
- add an event queue (execute function X after Y seconds or every Y seconds)
  (perhaps related to previous item)
- do something to help with +J and server restarts/crashes?
- expand iphash to count remote clients in a separate field and have a
  localmaxclientsperip and globalmaxclientsperip in Y:line (DONE)
- replace the old resolver code with adns? (see patch in patches/)
- remove +b %mask and use +q mask everywhere
