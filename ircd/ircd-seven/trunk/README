MODULE RESTARTS:
----------------

Note a running module should never be modified directly whilst it is
loaded into ircd as the behaviour of the OS can result in a core when
this is done.

When upgrading modules, you should never simply cp over a module that
is loaded into ircd.  You may delete it then cp, mv it, unload the
module from ircd first, move the directory out of the way and start
again or numerous other things.

Just *dont* do something like: cp m_foo.so ~/ircd/modules/
