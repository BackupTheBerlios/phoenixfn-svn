Current ratbox/charybdis flags:
    admin (A) -- module loading, "various privileges"
    remoteban (B) -- set k/xlines, resvs remotely, remote rehash
    local_kill (C)
    die (D) -- die, restart
    gline (G)
    rehash (H)
    kline (K) -- kline, dline
    operwall (L)
    nick_changes (N)
    global_kill (O)
    hidden_oper (P) -- does nothing
    remote (R) -- remote connect/squit
    oper_spy (S)
    unkline (U) -- unkline, undline, ungline iff G is also present
    xline (X) -- xline, unxline
    Plus various privileges granted to all opers regardless of
      flags.

Current hyperion flags:
    Too many to list.


Ratbox/charybdis flags corresponding to hyperion privs:
    Existing ratbox operflags cover:
        A - nothing I can see.
        B - irrelevant; all hyperion bans are global
        C - +K, or part thereof
        D - +D
        G - irrelevant; no glines.
        H - +H
        K - other half of +K
        L - +zZ
        N - +n
        O - +G
        P - irrelevant; all hyperion opers are hidden
        R - +S
        S - somewhat analogous to +a; see below.
        U - +U
        X - no equivalent; hyperion xlines are all done via config.
    Privileges granted to all opers:
        All notice umodes except n -- +bcdfklrsxyY
        Ability to use all STATS commands, though some may be
            restricted to admin-only in config -- +0123459v
        Overrides +g -- closest equivalent is probably +6?
        Ability to wallop and mass-notice -- +MW
        Flood immunity, higher priority(?) -- +hF
        Exemption from channel limits -- +u
        Ability to CONNECT and SQUIT locally -- +R
        Ability to see routing information -- +V, part of +A
        Ability to use TRACE and friends -- other half of +A
        Ability to set oper-only cmodes(+LP) (charybdis only) --
            this is split between +X and +P in hyperion.
        Ability to use SCAN -- other half of +X
        So, all ratbox opers have the equivalent of
            +bcdfklrsxyY +0123459v +MW +hF +R +VA +X +u6 and the
            ability to set cmode +P.
    Hyperion privileges not in ratbox:
        +BjmNpPT*@. The actions associated with these privilege
            flags have no analogy. For P@, CHGHOST is supported,
            but only accepted from remote servers (ie services),
            not from opers.
        +a warrants a note: the oper_spy privilege is somewhat
            analogous, though not entirely. Use of oper spy
            requires a special form of the command in question,
            emits snotes to all opers globally with +Z, and is
            logged.

New privilege set:
    All existing ratbox/charybdis oper flags except BGNPS should
        stay, with the following additions (naming arbitrary and
        subject to change):
    O and C (local and global kill) should be folded together.
    wallop -- can send wallops (+W)
    mass_notice -- can send mass notices (+M)
    routing -- CONNECT, SQUIT, sees through serverhide, view
        connection settings, stats ? (+R, +VA, +1. +5). Fold 
        'remote' into this.
    flood_immune -- immune to flood protection (+F)
    immune -- allows access to umode +m.
    override -- join anywhere, talk anywhere, op anywhere (+p)
    oper_cmodes -- can set +L, +P on channels. (parts of +p, +X)
    scan -- allows SCAN (part of +X)
    auspex -- replaces oper_spy and acts like +a.
    see_bans -- can list network bans and use TESTLINE (+239)
    helper -- can set equivalent to umode +T
    Server notice privileges -- set an allowed_snomask field in
        the oper block controlling what notices can be seen.

    current flags B, G, N, P are to be removed. S (operspy) is
        replaced by auspex. N is obsoleted by 'allowed snomasks',
        G-lines are to be removed since klines are clustered, and
        P is irrelevant since /stats p is reworked. B (remoteban)
        is to be implicit in K (kline)

    All opers can then be granted +u6 -- these are given out by
        services to non-opers at present, so granted them widely
        should not be a problem.

    This leave +BjNP*@ without equivalents. Auto-dline (+j) should
        be given its own flag if implemented.


TODO:
    stats T (+4). Not sure where to put it.
    umode +v.
