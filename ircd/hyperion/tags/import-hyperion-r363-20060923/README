hyperion 1.0
------------

This is the current hyperion ircd tree, forked from dancer-ircd 1.0.35+pre2.
Installation: ./configure with options, edit include/config.h and make && make
install. For the configuration file, go to ${prefix}/etc/dancer-ircd/,
copy example.conf to ircd.conf and edit it. Logs are under
${prefix}/var/log/dancer-ircd/.

For any possible updates see the Subversion repository:
http://svn.freenode.net/hyperion/trunk/
Note that the current plan (August 2005) is to abandon this tree and continue
development for hyperion 2.0 forking ircd-ratbox.

There are some misc patches in patches/.

There is some formal documentation in doc/sgml/. General TSora documentation
can be useful in understanding the server-server protocol but is not included
here.

Please mail bug reports to bugs@freenode.net, or ask in #hyperion
on freenode.

There are Debian packages available on http://debian.duckcorp.org/
but freenode has nothing to do with these. We have included
this link for the sole reason that many people ask for packages.
If you have a problem with the packages, please try compiling
from source if possible.

Services: Hyperion is designed to run with services; we know of two compatible
services packages: theia, which is a fork of dancer-services (from hybserv2)
and can be checked out from Subversion http://svn.freenode.net/theia/trunk/
and atheme, see http://www.atheme.org and http://www.atheme.net.
Freenode-registry will also run with hyperion, but it comprises a somewhat
unorthodox approach to authentication and authorization which may not meet the
needs of conventional IRC networks.
