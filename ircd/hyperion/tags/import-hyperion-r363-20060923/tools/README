Added debugnet.pl and proxytee.pl, which between them replace
the old debug-build target from the debian/ build systen. Run
tools/debugnet.pl from the top level directory to build an ircd and
create the debugging tree (debugnet.pl -h for parameter docs). When
this finishes, cd debug-tree && ./start to start all the ircds and
proxytee - a perl proxy which the ircds connect through, and which
dumps all through traffic to stdout. This has proven invaluable in
debugging in the past (I recommend starting with "./start | tee
proxy.log").

If the ircds are already running, just run ./proxy to start the proxy
alone without loading more copies of the ircds. Kill them off with
"killall ircd". Since the process names don't tell you which is which,
from debug-tree, use commands like "kill -HUP `cat
leaf2.dancer-debug`" or "gdb ircd `cat hub1.dancer-debug`" to work on
specific ones.

proxytee.pl has, just below the declaration of skip, a line like:
foreach my $command (qw/PING PONG SPINGTIME/)
The IRC protocol keywords quoted here identify messages which will
never be displayed, as a rudimentary filter.

Note: proxytee cannot handle zipped links at present. debugnet servers
must run uncompressed.
