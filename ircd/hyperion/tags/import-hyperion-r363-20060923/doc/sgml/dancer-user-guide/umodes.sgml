    <title>Users and umodes</title>
    <para>
      User modes (umodes) are set with the MODE command, in most clients either "/umode +i" or
      "/mode mynick +i". Here is a list of the ones which are available for general use:
    </para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>+i, invisible</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    This prevents you from appearing in global WHO/WHOIS by normal users, and hides which
	    channels you are on. It is strongly recommended that you set this umode.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>+w, see wallops</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    This umode lets you see the wallops announcement system. Important network messages will
	    be sent out via global notices; this is only for individual channel announcements and
	    anything else the network staff feel like saying to the world in general (<quote>moo!</quote>).
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>+I, block invite</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    This umode prevents anybody from inviting you to a channel. It effectively
	    limits you to public channels or to those you are on the invex lists for. (It can
	    safely be used to block somebody who is invite flooding)
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>+E, block unidentified</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    This umode prevents people who have not identified with nickserv from sending you
	    private messages (they will be told their messages are bouncing).
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>+Q, block forwarding</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            This umode prevents you from being affected by any of the channel forwarding mechanisms. In
            any event where you would normally be forwarded, instead you will get the usual error message
            as if no forwarding was in effect.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>+C, block CTCP</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    This umode prevents you from receiving CTCP messages or sending CTCP
	    replies. This will stop anybody from CTCP flooding you. Note that this only
	    affects CTCP messages/replies to/from *you*; it won't stop you receiving channel
	    CTCP, although it will block your response to them.
	  </para>
          <para>
            CTCP ACTION messages are explicitly excluded; they are unaffected by the +C mode.
          </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
