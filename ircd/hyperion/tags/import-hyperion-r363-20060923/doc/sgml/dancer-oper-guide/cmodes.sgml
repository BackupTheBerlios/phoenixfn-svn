      <title>Meanings of cmodes</title>
      <sect2>
	<title>+b, channel ban</title>
	<para>
	  Bans take one parameter, either in the form +b nick!user@host, or +b
	  nick!user@host!#channel. The wildcards * and ? are allowed, matching zero-or-more, and
	  exactly-one characters respectively. The masks will be trimmed to fit the maximum allowable
	  length for the relevant element, with wildcards added as appropriate to ensure that they still
	  match.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In the simple case, without a !#channel, the mask causes any matching user to be prohibited
	  from sending to the channel, knocking, or joining. Having +v set on them on the channel
	  overrides the prohibition on sending.
	</para>
	<para>
	  If the mask has a channel name specified, then in all situations where the user would
	  previously have been told they could not join the channel, they will instead join the channel
	  named in the ban mask, and be sent a 470 numeric describing that.
	</para>
	<para>
	  If the mask is prefixed with a percent sign, affected users may
	  still join; the net effect is that they cannot send to the channel.
	  This is also accepted as +q mask instead of +b %mask.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+c, colour filter</title>
	<para>
	  This cmode activates the colour filter for the channel. This filters out bold, underline,
	  reverse video, beeps, mIRC colour codes, and ANSI escapes. Note that escape sequences will
	  usually leave cruft sent to the channel, just without the escape characters themselves.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+d, gecos ban</title>
	<para>
	  This mode takes on parameter, a mask which is matched against the "Real name" field
	  each client supplies, and prevents any matching clients from sending to the channel or joining
	  it. It accepts the standard * and ? wildcards.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>+D, automatic D:line</title>
        <para>
          This mode takes one parameter of the form "x,y", where x and y are positive integers. These two
          integers monitor the rate at which users may join the channel. The limit is roughly y users
          every x*y seconds, but the algorithm allows for bursts. If this limit is exceeded, a D:line is
          placed on the IP-address of every user in the channel at the time.
        </para>
        <para>
          More precisely, a counter is maintained which is incremented by one for every user that
          successfully joins the channel, and decremented by one every x seconds. When a user joins and
          the counter is greater than limit (after incrementing), the channel is cleared out.
        </para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+e, ban exemption</title>
	<para>
	  This mode takes on parameter of the form nick!user@host, with the usual wildcards, which
	  overrides +b and +d bans for all clients it matches.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+f, channel forwarding</title>
	<para>
	  This mode takes one parameter, the name of a channel (+f #channel). If the channel also has the
	  +i cmode set, and somebody attempts to join without either being expliticly invited, or having
	  an invex (+I), then they will instead join the channel named in the mode parameter. The client
	  will also be sent a 470 numeric giving the original and target channels.
	</para>
        <para>
          Users are similarly forwarded if the +J cmode is set and their attempt to join is throttled, or
          if +r is set and they are not identified.
        </para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+g, allow anybody to invite</title>
	<para>
	  When this mode is set, anybody may use the INVITE command on the channel in question. When it
	  is unset, only channel operators may use the INVITE command.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+i, invite only</title>
	<para>
	  When this cmode is set, no client can join the channel unless they have an invex (+I) or are
	  invited with the INVITE command.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+I, invite exception (invex)</title>
	<para>
	  This mode takes a parameter of the form nick!user@host with the usual wildcards. Matching
	  clients do not need to be invited to join the channel when it is invite-only (+i).
	  They may also join the channel if it is +r even though they are not
	  identified, or if it is +J and too many users have joined recently.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+j, jupe channel</title>
	<para>
	  This cmode can only be set by network operators (+p). It basically prohibits the channel from being
	  used for any purpose, anywhere on the network. Joining such channels is not possible and causes
	  a warning to be sent to all users with umode +y.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>+J, join throttling</title>
        <para>
          This mode takes one parameter of the form "x,y", where x and y are positive integers. These two
          integers control the rate at which users may join the channel. The limit is roughly y users
          every x*y seconds, but the algorithm allows for bursts.
        </para>
        <para>
          More precisely, a counter is maintained which is incremented by one for every user that
          successfully joins the channel, and decremented by one every x seconds. When the counter is
          equal to limit, no more users may join.
        </para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+k, key (channel password)</title>
	<para>
	  Taking one parameter, when set, this mode requires a user to supply the key in order to join
	  the channel: /JOIN #channel key.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+l, channel member limit</title>
	<para>
	  Takes one numeric parameter, the number of users which are allowed to be in the channel before
	  further joins are blocked.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+L, large ban list</title>
	<para>
	  Channels with this mode will be allowed larger banlists (by default,
          500 instead of 50 entries for +b, +q, +d, +e and +I together).
	  Only operators with umode +X may set this.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+m, moderated</title>
	<para>
	  When a channel is set +m, only users with +o or +v on the channel can send to it.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+n, prevent external send to channel</title>
	<para>
	  When set, this mode prevents users from sending to the channel without being in it themselves.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+P, permanent channel</title>
	<para>
	  Channels with this mode (which is accessible only to network operators with umode +p) set will not be destroyed
	  when the last user leaves.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+q, quiet</title>
	<para>
	  This mode behaves exactly like the simple form of +b (ban), except that the user may still join
	  the channel. The net effect is that they cannot send to the channel.
	  This mode is sent as +b %mask to clients.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>+Q, block forwarded users</title>
        <para>
          Channels with this mode set are not valid targets for forwarding. Any attempt to forward to
          this channel will be ignored, and the user will be handled as if the attempt was ever made (by
          sending them the relevant error message).
        </para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>+r, block unidentified</title>
        <para>
          When set, this mode prevents unidentified users from joining.
        </para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>+R, quiet unidentified</title>
        <para>
          When set, this mode prevents unidentified users from sending to the channel, although they can
          still join.
        </para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+s, secret channel</title>
	<para>
	  When set, this mode prevents the channel from appearing in the
	  output of the LIST, WHO and WHOIS command by users who are not on
	  it. Also, the server will refuse to answer WHO, NAMES, TOPIC and
	  LIST queries from users not on the channel.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>+z, reduced moderation</title>
        <para>
          When +z is set, the effects of +b, +q, and +m are relaxed. For each message, if that message
          would normally be blocked by one of these modes, it is instead sent to all the users who are
          currently set +o. This is intended for use in moderated debates.
        </para>
        <para>
          Note that +n is unaffected by this. To silence a given user completely, remove them from the
          channel.
        </para>
