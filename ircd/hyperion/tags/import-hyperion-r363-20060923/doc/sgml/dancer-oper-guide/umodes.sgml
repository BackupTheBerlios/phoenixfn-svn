      <title>Allowed vs. default umodes</title>
      <para>
	In dancer, every operator is granted a set of allowed umodes, and default umodes.
      </para>
      <para>
	Default umodes are those which are automatically set when the person becomes an operator
	with the OPER command.
      </para>
      <para>
	Allowed umodes are those which the user may set on themselves afterwards. These will be
	listed when the OPER command is successfully invoked.

      <sect2 id="userauspexmode">
	<title>+a, user auspex</title>
	<para>
	  User auspex is the ability to see all users and channels. Users with this mode set can see
	  inivisible users and secret channels, and all members. Care should be taken to keep this
	  information private, and not reveal it to non-auspex users.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2 id="auspexmode">
	<title>+A, auspex</title>
	<para>
	  Auspex is the ability to see all servers and IP addresses. Care should be taken to keep this
	  information private, and not reveal it to non-auspex users.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+b, see bots</title>
	<para>
	  Users with the +b umode set will receive warning messages from the server when potentiol
	  flooders and spambots are detected.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+B, edit other users</title>
	<para>
	  This umode allows the operator to use the SETHOST, SETNAME, and SETIDENT commands on other
	  people. It also allows the operator to change another person's umode, although they cannot
	  grant modes that the target user doesn't have without <link linkend="grantmode">+*, grant
	  modes</link>.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+c, see client connections</title>
	<para>
	  Users who have the +c umode set will receive server notices when clients attach to the
	  network. Netjoins are included, but netsplits are not.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>+C, block CTCP</title>
        <para>
	  <note>
	    <para>
	      This is a user umode, which anybody can set. It is not specific to operators.
	    </para>
	  </note>
          This umode prevents you from receiving CTCP messages or sending CTCP
          replies. This will stop anybody from CTCP flooding you. Note that this only
          affects CTCP messages/replies to/from *you*; it won't stop you receiving channel
          CTCP, although it will block your response to them.
        </para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+d, debug</title>
	<para>
	  The +d umode provides extra information and commands which may be of interest to debuggers.
	  It will also cause the user to receive server notices if certain assertions fail inside the
	  server. It's precise meaning is extremely variable. While every effort will be made to ensure
	  that it grants no extra privileges, no guarantees can be made. Do not depend on the
	  effects of this umode as they can and will change without notice in later revisions.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Note that this may (and usually will) divulge information about the network routing. It may
	  also give away IP addresses. Yeah, it's a security risk. Sorry.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+D, die command</title>
	<para>
	  The DIE command causes a server to cease processing at once and exit.
	  The RESTART command causes a server to reexecute the compiled-in
	  ircd filename, breaking all connections.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+e, identified</title>
	<para>
	  This umode is used for integration with services. A user with the +e umode has successfully
	  identified with nickserv.
	  <warning>
	    <para>
	      Under no circumstances should +e be granted in an O:line.
	    </para>
	  </warning>
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+E, reject messages from unidentified users</title>
	<para>
	  <note>
	    <para>
	      This is a user umode, which anybody can set. It is not specific to operators.
	    </para>
	  </note>
	  If a user has the +E umode set, then any users who do <emphasis>not</emphasis> have
	  the +e umode set will receive an error message if they attempt to send a private
	  message or notice to the +E user.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+f, full warning</title>
	<para>
	  Users with the +f umode set will receive notices when an I:line becomes full, and
	  users can no longer connect.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+F, immune to flood protection</title>
	<para>
	  +F users will not be throttled in their use of commands, nor will they be checked
	  by the flood detection code.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+G, global kill</title>
	<para>
	  An operator who can do global kills can kill a user who is attached to a different
	  server. See <link linkend="localkillmode">+K, local kill</link>.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2 id="highprioritymode">
	<title>+h, high priority</title>
	<para>
	  A person with high priority set will have their connection polled more often by the
	  server, and will still be able to do stuff while the server is in high traffic mode.
	  Normally, high traffic mode means that most commands from attached clients will be
	  rejected, until the server can clear it's backlog of processing. This mode should be
	  granted sparingly, to only those people who would need to be able to work rapidly when
	  the server is under extreme load.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+H, rehash</title>
	<para>
	  This grants the ability to use the rehash command, to reload the server configuration
	  files, and the set command, to dynamically change certain options,
	  both in their local and remote forms.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+i, invisible</title>
	<para>
	  <note>
	    <para>
	      This is a user umode, which anybody can set. It is not specific to operators.
	    </para>
	  </note>
	  Invisible users do not show up in WHO unless you can see them, and their WHOIS will
	  only show channels on which you can see them. See <link linkend="userauspexmode">+a, auspex</link>.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+I, refuse invite</title>
	<para>
	  <note>
	    <para>
	      This is a user umode, which anybody can set. It is not specific to operators.
	    </para>
	  </note>
	  If you have the +I umode set, nobody will be able to issue an INVITE to let you
	  in to a channel.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+j, autodline</title>
	<para>
	  This grants the ability to set or unset cmode +D, to automatically
	  dline all clients in a channel when a certain join rate is exceeded.
	  This umode also grants immunity to +D's effect.
	  Dlines are quite hard to remove so caution is advised.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+k, server kill notices</title>
	<para>
	  Users with the +k umode set will receive server notices when kills
	  occur: oper kills, server kills and kline/dline active.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2 id="localkillmode">
	<title>+K, local kill</title>
	<para>
	  With the +K umode, a person can set klines and use the KILL command, to remove people
	  from the server they are connected to.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+l, channel creation notices</title>
	<para>
	  A user with +l set will receive a server notice when a new channel is created (by somebody
	  entering it).
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+L, force lusers</title>
	<para>
	  With the +L umode set, a user can use the 4-argument LUSERS message to force a recount.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+m, immune</title>
	<para>
	  A user with +m cannot be kicked or deopped and is immune to autodline (cmode +D).
	  This is a very dangerous umode. It is suggested
	  that m never be put in the default umodes for anybody.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+M, mass notices</title>
	<para>
	  A user with +M set can send notices to people based on a mask. A notice to $* will go
	  out to every user on the network.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+n, nick change notices</title>
	<para>
	  A user with +n set will receive a server notice every time somebody changes their nick,
	  giving the old and new nicks.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+N, use any nick</title>
	<para>
	  The +N umode overrides Q:lines, which normally forbid the use of given nicks.
	  This is potentially useful if running without services, to protect the nicks of opers, should
	  you wish to do that.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+o, operator</title>
	<para>
	  This indicates global operator status. It's meaning is now minimal; it is a gateway to the
	  operator umodes. Setting -o will automatically remove all the operator umodes. The things
	  which +o still does are listed in <link linkend="newopers">Dancer operators</link>.
	  <warning>
	    <para>
	      Under no circumstances should +o be granted in an O:line.
	    </para>
	  </warning>
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+p, god mode</title>
	<para>
	  Users with this umode can always join channels and speak regardless of channel modes, limits, or bans.
	  They can also send mode changes to any channel, and jupe
	  channels (+j) or make them permanent (+P).
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+P, SETHOST, SETIDENT and SETNAME</title>
	<para>
	  This umode allows the use of the commands SETHOST, SETIDENT and
	  SETNAME, to change hostname, username and realname.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+Q, block forwarding</title>
	<para>
	  <note>
	    <para>
	      This is a user umode, which anybody can set. It is not specific to operators.
	    </para>
	  </note>
          This umode prevents you from being affected by any of the channel forwarding mechanisms. In
          any event where you would normally be forwarded, instead you will get the usual error message
          as if no forwarding was in effect.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+r, notices on name rejections</title>
	<para>
	  Users with this umode set will receive a server notice when somebody tries to use an
	  invalid nick/username, or a quarantined nick (Q:link) or banned realname (X:line).
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+R, server routing</title>
	<para>
	  This umode grants the use of the commands CONNECT and SQUIT, in both local and
	  remote forms.  It also allows the use of the HTM command to query/change current
	  HTM settings.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+s, server notices</title>
	<para>
	  This umode allows a user to receive generic server notices.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+S, run commands remotely</title>
	<para>
	  This allows various commands, notably ADMIN, INFO, MOTD, VERSION, and STATS, to be used
	  in their remote form, where an extra server parameter is given and the command executes
	  on a remote server, returning results to the user.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Note that this umode does <emphasis>not</emphasis> affect the local or remote forms of
	  the CONNECT and SQUIT commands; these are controlled entirely by umode +R.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This umode also does not affect the local or remote forms of
	  the REHASH and SET commands; these are controlled entirely by umode +H.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+T, show as staff</title>
	<para>
	  The command /stats p shows a list of users (on all servers) with
	  this umode set.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+u, join more channels</title>
	<para>
	  Users with +u may join more channels at a time (MAXCHANNELSMORE
          instead of MAXCHANNELSPERUSER, default 100 instead of 20).
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+U, unkline</title>
	<para>
	  This grants the use of the UNKLINE command. Note that unklines only
	  apply after a REHASH so this umode is not much use without +H.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+v, view privileges</title>
	<para>
	  This causes the privileges an oper has available to be returned when the +v user WHOIS's them.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+V, view routing</title>
	<para>
	  This allows the routing between the servers to be seen. This activates the MAP command, and
	  shows routing information in LINKS, as well as showing full server connection messages.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+w, receive wallops</title>
	<para>
	  <note>
	    <para>
	      This is a user umode, which anybody can set. It is not specific to operators.
	    </para>
	  </note>
	  Users with the +w umode set will receive WALLOPS messages.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+W, send wallops</title>
	<para>
	  Users with the +W umode can use the WALLOPS command to send WALLOPS messages.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+x, see servers joining</title>
	<para>
	  People who have the +x umode set will see all servers being introduced when a server
	  rejoins, not just the one which made the connection. (This means all the servers
	  already connected on the other side of the link). This obviously divulges routing
	  information, and is rather loud on a large network. Its value is uncertain.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This also gives notices on each rehash about include files
	  and a few other messages about server connections.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+X, experimental features</title>
	<para>
	  This umode controls access to various experimental features. It is deliberately
	  undocumented. If you do not know what it does (if you are not involved in the development)
	  then you should not use it. The features it controls will eventually be moved
	  out and documented when their usage (and their side effects) are better understood.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Currently this affects cmode +L (large ban list), /quote scan
	  and /quote tsdelta.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+y, spy</title>
	<para>
	  Users with this umode receive notices when certain special commands
	  are used, such as ADMIN and LINKS (but not STATS and WHOIS), and
	  also when users try to join juped (+j) channels.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+Y, server connection details</title>
	<para>
	  This umode activates some extra messages sent during server connection, which used to be
	  attached to +s. It exists mostly so that it can be turned off if these messages become
	  bothersome.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+z, receive operwall</title>
	<para>
	  OPERWALL differs from WALLOPS in that the ability to receive such messages is
	  restricted. Users with +z set will receive OPERWALL messages.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+Z, send operwall</title>
	<para>
	  The ability to send OPERWALL messages is controlled by the +Z umode.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+0, see opers</title>
	<para>
	  Users with the +0 umode can use STATS o to see O:lines and get
	  a notice when someone successfully uses the OPER command to become
	  an operator. (Failed OPER notices are bound to +s.)
	  Also, if OPERHIDE is defined (default), only users with the +0
	  umode set are able to tell that a person is an oper in WHOIS, WHO,
	  USERHOST and in various other commands such as TRACE.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+1, see connection settings</title>
	<para>
	  This umode allows the use of STATS commands to see: 
	  <simplelist>
	    <member>I:lines</member>
	    <member>Y:lines</member>
	  </simplelist>
	</para>
      </sect2>

	    <member>X:lines</member>
	  </simplelist>
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+4, see STATS T</title>
	<para>
	  This allows the use of the STATS T command, to get general server statistics.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+5, see STATS ?</title>
	<para>
	  This allows the use of the STATS ? command, to get a list of all servers and 
	  some statistics on them from the perspective of the current server,
	  in particular estimated bandwidth usage.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+9, use testline</title>
	<para>
	  This umode enables the TESTLINE command.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2 id="grantmode">
	<title>+*, grant umodes</title>
	<para>
	  This umode allows the user to grant umodes they have access to to other people.
	  As such it is very dangerous, and should be carefully controlled. It is strongly
	  recommended that * never be put in the default umodes for anybody, and that it
	  only be set when it is needed, to prevent accidents.
	</para>
	<para>
	  When a user has +* set, then they may set a mode on another user which that user
	  would not normally have access to (assuming the originator has the ability to gain
	  that mode themselves). This umode will be added to the list of umodes that the
	  target has access to for the duration of the session. Similarly, removing a umode
	  will revoke the ability to use that mode, unless it is in the list of normal user
	  modes.

	<para>
	  This umode allows the user to change their host to anything with the SETHOST command. Without
