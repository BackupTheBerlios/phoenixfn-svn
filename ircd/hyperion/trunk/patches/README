hyperion patches
----------------

These patches include features that are contrary to freenode goals or
are not tested enough yet.

To apply a patch, execute from the top level source directory something like:
patch -p0 <patches/hyperion-patchname.patch

To create patches, do from the top level source directory of a modified
Subversion checkout (e.g. trunk/) something like:
svn diff >patches/hyperion-newpatch.patch

Usable patches: (if any of these does not apply, please contact us)

hyperion-proper-netsplit-quits.patch: apply this patch and define
GIMME_PROPER_NETSPLIT_QUITS_ANYWAY in config.h to get proper netsplit quits;
obviously, this breaks serverhide.

Work in progress patches: (DO NOT simply apply)

hyperion-encap.patch: a (crude) shot at an ENCAP implementation, by jilles

hyperion-newparse.patch: a patch improving the command parsing, by nenolod

hyperion-svsnick.patch: a patch adding an SVSNICK command to change a user's
nick from services, killing any existing user first; same purpose as
ircd-ratbox's RSFNC; written by GXTi and jilles

hyperion-use-adns.patch: move from the old resolver code to adns, by nenolod
